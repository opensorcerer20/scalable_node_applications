google search "make node server with typescript"

To set up a Node.js server with TypeScript, follow these steps: Initialize a new Node.js project. 
    mkdir my-ts-server
    cd my-ts-server
    npm init -y

• Install dependencies: Install Express (or another framework), TypeScript, and type definitions for Node.js and Express. 

    npm install express
    npm install -D typescript @types/node @types/express ts-node-dev

• ts-node-dev is recommended for development, as it automatically restarts the server on file changes. 

• Configure TypeScript: Generate a tsconfig.json file to configure the TypeScript compiler. 

    npx tsc --init

Modify tsconfig.json to suit your needs. Key settings for a Node.js project often include: 
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2016",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules"]
    }

• Create your Express application: Create a src directory and an index.ts file within it. 

    // src/index.ts
    import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

    const app = express();
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

    app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
      res.send('Hello from TypeScript Express!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
    });

Add scripts to package.json. 
    {
      "name": "my-ts-server",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc",
        "start": "node dist/index.js",
        "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/index.ts"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "devDependencies": {
        "@types/express": "^4.17.21",
        "@types/node": "^20.14.9",
        "ts-node-dev": "^2.0.0",
        "typescript": "^5.5.3"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.19.2"
      }
    }

• Run the server: 
	• For development with hot-reloading: npm run dev 
	• For production (build and run): 

        npm run build
        npm run start

google search "environment variables typescript node"

In a Node.js application written with TypeScript, environment variables are typically managed to provide configuration and sensitive data (like API keys or database credentials) without hardcoding them directly into the codebase. This enhances security and allows for easy configuration changes across different environments (development, testing, production). 
Accessing Environment Variables: 
Node.js provides the process.env object to access environment variables. For example, process.env.PORT would access a variable named PORT. 
Managing Environment Variables with TypeScript: 

• Using .env files and dotenv: 
	• Create a .env file in the root of your project to store key-value pairs of your environment variables (e.g., PORT=3000, DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase). 
	• Install the dotenv package: npm install dotenv. 
	• Load the variables in your application's entry point (e.g., index.ts or server.ts) before other code that uses them: 

        import dotenv from 'dotenv';
        dotenv.config();

• Adding Type Safety for process.env: 
	• By default, TypeScript treats process.env as an object with a string indexer, meaning it doesn't know the specific properties available or their types. This can lead to runtime errors if variables are misspelled or missing. 
	• To add type safety, create a declaration file (e.g., process-env.d.ts) in your project's root or src directory and declare the types of your environment variables within the NodeJS.ProcessEnv interface: 

        declare global {
          namespace NodeJS {
            interface ProcessEnv {
              PORT: string;
              DATABASE_URL: string;
              // Add other environment variables here with their types
            }
          }
        }
        export {}; // To make it a module

• Ensure this declaration file is included in your tsconfig.json's include array. 

Using the Typed Environment Variables. 
Once types are defined, you can access your environment variables with type-checking and autocompletion: 
    const port = process.env.PORT; // TypeScript now knows 'port' is a string
    const databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

Alternative for Type Safety and Validation: 
Libraries like env-var or Zod can be used for more robust validation and type coercion of environment variables, providing more detailed error messages and ensuring required variables are present. These tools can parse and validate your environment variables against a defined schema, offering a more structured approach to managing configuration.
